# Deal Scraper (Infosys Internship) üöÄ

## Project Overview

The **Deal Scraper** is an automated web scraping tool designed to extract deal posts from various e-commerce websites. Developed during my internship at **Infosys**, this tool leverages Python, Selenium, and the **Gemini Flash API** to dynamically scrape deals regardless of website structure. Achieving a 95% scraping success rate, the scraper minimizes manual effort, automates workflows, and integrates robust error-handling mechanisms to enhance reliability and efficiency.

## Key Features ‚ú®
- **Automated Scraping**: Extract deal posts from multiple e-commerce websites with minimal manual intervention.
- **Dynamic Website Support**: Powered by the Gemini Flash API to handle various website structures, ensuring high scraping success rates.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error-handling mechanisms that reduce scraping failures and enhance reliability.
- **Reusable Scripts**: Modular and reusable scripts to simplify complex web structure handling and increase development speed.
- **High Success Rate**: Achieved 95% scraping accuracy even for dynamically loaded content.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: For core scraping logic and automation.
- **Selenium**: To interact with dynamic content on websites and simulate user actions.
- **Gemini Flash API**: To dynamically adjust scraping methods based on different website layouts.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For HTML parsing and data extraction.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error-handling mechanisms built into the scripts.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajay3371/deal-scraper.git
```

### 2. Install required dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Gemini Flash API
Follow the API documentation to obtain access to Gemini Flash API and integrate it with your scraper.

### 4. Run the scraper
To start scraping deals, simply run the script:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

### 5. Customization
You can customize the scraper for different e-commerce websites by modifying the configuration files and updating the parsing logic as per the site's structure.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Website Detection**: The scraper detects dynamic and static websites, adjusting scraping methods accordingly using the Gemini Flash API.
2. **Data Extraction**: After successfully navigating the site, the scraper extracts deal information like title, price, link, and more.
3. **Error Handling**: If the scraping process encounters an error, the tool will automatically retry or log the issue for further analysis.
4. **Result Storage**: The scraped data is stored in a structured format (JSON/CSV) for further analysis or integration into other systems.

## Achievements üéØ
- **95% Scraping Success Rate**: Achieved high accuracy in dynamic web scraping, reducing manual effort.
- **Error-Resilient**: Built-in error handling drastically reduced scraping failures, ensuring seamless operation.
- **Reusable Codebase**: Optimized and modular scripts that are easy to reuse and extend for other projects.

## Screenshots üì∏
